For this problem, you need to print the text "Hello, World!" (without the quotes).
This serves to see if you have your environment setup properly, and can successfully submit homework.
Once you complete this problem, submit it IMMEDIATELY, so that I know everyone has a working environment and can submit homework.
If you run into problems, please contact me ASAP (donald_pinckney@icloud.com)
